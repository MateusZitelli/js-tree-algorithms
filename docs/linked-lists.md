Advantages:

* Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, allocating the needed memory when the program is initiated.

* Insertion and deletion node operations are easily implemented in a linked list.

* Linear data structures such as stacks and queues are easily executed with a linked list.

* They can reduce access time and may expand in real time without memory overhead.


Disadvantages:

* They have a tendency to waste memory due to pointers requiring extra storage space.

* Nodes in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning as linked lists are inherently sequential access.

* Nodes are stored incontiguously, greatly increasing the time required to access individual elements within the list.

* Difficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing. Singly linked lists are extremely difficult to navigate backwards, and while doubly linked lists are somewhat easier to read, memory is wasted in allocating space for a back pointer.
